As an Android developer having worked for 2 top companies in India,  I bet I have a story to tell about my journey as Android Dev @DailyHunt and Myntra

Cupcake, Donut, Eclair, Froyo, Icecreamsandwich, JellyBean, Kitkat with its increasing Multiprocessing capabilities did not quite astonish an App Developer's UI sense.

And then the era of Material Design introduced in Android Lollipop which took UI developer's ecosystem restless and wanting for more to keep the users happy on App and Web alike.
